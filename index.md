# Please strike informal conversations with hello in chat

## TL;DR


Modern chat communication should be done in a way that is fun for everyone. Share something informal and while having fun we can discuss serious topics like what you had for dinner yesterday. It is fun for all participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information.  
There will always be a surprise element when there is “Hello” in chat like this conversation will be so happening. Feel free to call me out of the blue.  
Phrase a message that allows your chat partners to come up with an interesting life-altering story to tell you that they cannot wait to tell you as soon as they read and answer your message.
